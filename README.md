# Cakefest 2025 Workshop 1

We'll use this repo as a reference for the https://cakefest.org workshop 1 contents.

The finished code is under branch workshop1.

Slides are here > https://speakerdeck.com/steinkel/cakefest-2025-workshop-1 

The file https://github.com/steinkel/cakefest2025/blob/master/step-by-step.md contains the step by step we are going to follow in the workshop session to skip most of the typing.

We are going to build together a **Hotel Reservation System**.

Comments and questions are welcome!

Thank you.
